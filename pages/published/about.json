After earning my Bachelor of Science in Computer Science from Simon Fraser University in 2020 I also moved to Chicago, Illinois to be with my partner and our talkative cuddly cat.\r\n\r\nSince then I have been a developer in different capacities. I designed and developed two artist websites. I am also a volunteer lead developer for Code for Chicago, specifically building a new website for Cannabis Equity Illinois Coalition, which is a local non-profit that helps with expungements for cannabis convictions and advocates for reform. I am also a freelance email developer for Mission Wired, and I do freelance AutoCAD drafting for Measure Masters.\r\n\r\nI am always excited to learn new languages while constantly sharpening the ones I know. Currently, I am working on an open-source CMS and a fitness app, among others to expand my scope and apply my knowledge and experience to professional opportunities.\r\n\r\nIn my spare time, I am learning how to play the guitar, work out, learn Spanish, cook and bake, and soak as much sun as I can."}]}
